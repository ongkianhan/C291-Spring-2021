Final Submission for Snake Game

This game has been built on code by two authors, Kent Ong and Gabriel Jude, both students in the Spring'21 C291 course at IU's Luddy School, offered by 
Professor Adeel Bhutta.

This version of Snake is built on IU's remote server Silo, using C and ncurses library on Linux. This version of Snake is similar to the popular version of the game we 
love with extra functions. Dodge obstacles and eat food with your snake to increase your score! Beware of the enemy snake that lurks in the game that will also kill you 
upon contact...

Obstacles, food and snakes are color coded.

** So far, snake is unable to reverse after hitting obstacles, this function in the game is still a work in progress. **


Controls are as follows:

W A S D OR Arrow Keys - movement controls: Up, Left, Down, Right respectively
q or Q - quit the game
'+' - increase the size of the board
'-' - decrease the size of the board
f or F - to save the state of the game into a file, that can be loaded at a later time
l or L - to load a saved game

The game can be run on three different difficulties, each with different speeds of the snake, number of food items and number of obstacles. 
E or e - Easy
H or H - Hard
V or v - Advanced

The game can also be run on multiplayer, which allows for a maximum of 2 snakes to be playing at concurrently the same time.

** Note, player 1 will have movement controls WASD, and player 2 will have movement controls of the arrow keys. **
